The applicant\u2019s claim is misleading and unfounded.    </span>   </p>   <p style=\"margin-top:12.5pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-align:justify; line-height:13.25pt\">    <span>     PETITONER\u2019S SECOND CONTENTION \u2013 TEMPORARY DISABILITY    </span>   </p>   <p style=\"margin-top:6.35pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-align:justify; line-height:13.75pt\">    <span>     The applicant contends that the finding of fact that he should not be precluded from litigating TD \u201cin the future\u201d is unclear, at best. On the MOH from the first trial-setting day, it is noted that the applicant\u2019s counsel stated there was a claim for TD, although none was identified on    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     the    </span>    <span>     PTCS, and the record at that time suggested the applicant worked at two jobs subsequent to Medline.

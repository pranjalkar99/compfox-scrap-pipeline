Prior to being selected, Coach Mike McCarthy called the applicant to tell him that they were going to draft him. The draft was then announced on television. During the phone call, he was    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     told    </span>    <span>     that he was becoming a Green Bay Packer, and they had his rights; so he could not go with any other team (MOH/SOE 04/05/2023, page 5, lines    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     12-    </span>    <span>     14). The applicant agreed to    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     the    </span>    <span>     terms while he was in    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     the    </span>    <span>     state    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.1pt\">     of    </span>    <span>     California (MOH/SOE 04/05/2023, page 8, lines 22- 23).    </span>   </p>   <p style=\"margin-top:0.05pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:36pt; text-align:justify; line-height:20.6pt\">    <span>     Shortly after the draft,    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     the    </span>    <span>     applicant received a fax that had been sent to    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     his    </span>    <span>     agent. On    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     the    </span>    <span>     fax cover sheet there were two names, Russ Ball and Ken Zuckerman.    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     Mr.    </span>    <span>     Zuckerman was the applicant\u2019s agent. The applicant understood this to mean that he was officially a Green Bay Packer at that time (MOH/SOE 04/05/2023, page 5, lines 19 - 22). Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 4 is a fax cover sheet dated May 2, 2011, addressed to Ken Zuckerman, the applicant\u2019s agent. The fax number has an 818 area code which    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.1pt\">     is    </span>    <span>     a California area code. The fax was from Russ Ball \u201cVice President    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.1pt\">     of    </span>    <span>     Football Administration/Player Finance.\u201d The second page of Exhibit 4    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.1pt\">     is    </span>    <span>     a letter that reads as follows:    </span>   </p>   <p style=\"margin-top:17.4pt; margin-left:43.2pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-align:justify; line-height:13.25pt\">    <span>     Davon House 2225 Carolyn Drive Palmdale, CA    </span>    <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">    </span>    <span>     93551    </span>   </p>   <p style=\"margin:0.05pt 33.5pt 0pt 43.2pt; text-align:justify; line-height:13.75pt\">    <span>     Dear Davon:    </span>    <span style=\"-aw-import:spaces\">    </span>    <span>     This will serve as notice that pursuant to Article XVI, Section 3 of the CBA,    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     the    </span>    <span>     Club is deemed to have automatically tendered you a one year NFL Player Contract with a Paragraph 5 Salary of $330,000. Sincerely, Russ Ball, Vice Present Football Administration Player Finance    </span>   </p>   <p style=\"margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:36pt; text-align:justify; line-height:20.75pt\">    <span>     Here, pursuant to the unrebutted testimony of the Applicant and evidentiary evidence,    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     the    </span>    <span>     applicant was a resident of California at time    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.1pt\">     of    </span>    <span>     telephone call with Coach McCarthy on Draft Day.    </span>   </p>   <p style=\"margin-top:0.05pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:36pt; text-align:justify; line-height:20.6pt\">    <span>     Therefore, the question then turns to where the contract for hire was made. Was the contract for hire made orally during the telephone call with Coach McCarthy    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.1pt\">     or    </span>    <span>     when the applicant actually signed the contract? The Applicant testified that in order to    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     play,    </span>    <span>     the applicant had to sign the actual contracts (MOH/SOE, page 6, lines 18-19). When he was under contract with    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     the    </span>    <span>     team, he was a member of the NFL Players Association, and the rules of    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     the    </span>    <span>     collective bargaining agreement were in place (MOH/SOE, page 6, lines 20- 21). It is possible that the applicant was in Green Bay on July 29, 2011, when the contract was signed (MOH/SOE, page 6, lines 23-25).    </span>   </p>   <p style=\"margin-top:0.05pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:36pt; text-align:justify; line-height:20.75pt\">    <span>     In general, in order for a contract to be formed there must be an offer, acceptance and consideration, here, the offer was made during the telephone call between    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     the    </span>    <span>     applicant and Coach McCarthy. The applicant accepted the offer and he believed he knew how much he would be paid, which is the consideration of the oral contract. The offer, acceptance and the consideration was confirmed via the fax    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     sent    </span>    <span>     to the applicant\u2019s agent (Exhibit 4).    </span>    <span style=\"-aw-import:spaces\">    </span>    <span>     A contract    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.1pt\">     of    </span>    <span>     hire, in the workers\u2019 compensation context departs from the common law of contracts. In workers\u2019 comp, a contract is formed where the acceptance of the offer physically tasks place. The physical location of the person accepting the employer\u2019s offer is crucial to the determination of whether the contract of hire was formed in this state. An employment contract is deemed to have been made in California if the act of acceptance takes place in California (    </span>    <span style=\"font-style:italic\">     Reynolds Electrical &amp; Engineering Co., Inc. v. WCAB (Egan)    </span>    <span>     1966 31 CCC 415.) Here, an oral contract consummated over the telephone on Draft day between the applicant and Coach McCarthy.    </span>   </p>   <p style=\"margin-top:0.05pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:36pt; text-align:justify; line-height:20.75pt\">    <span>     California can assert subject matter jurisdiction over a team because    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.05pt\">     the    </span>    <span>     terms    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.1pt\">     of    </span>    <span>     the contract were agreed to in California and the applicant\u2019s signing of the formal documents were a condition subsequent.    </span>    <span style=\"font-style:italic\">     The    </span>    <span>    </span>    <span style=\"font-style:italic\">     Travelers Insurance Co. v.

This was not an issue raised with specificity at the time of trial and therefore, appears to have been waived. This argument was first raised in Defendant\u2019s trial brief. On the other hand, this may fall under the broader category of jurisdiction and whether this Court does in fact have the power to hear the issues presented in this case. Thus, the Court will address Defendant\u2019s contention and will not consider it waived.    </span>   </p>   <p style=\"margin-top:0.05pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:36pt; text-align:justify; line-height:20.65pt\">    <span>     Determination of Subject Matter Jurisdiction is within this Court\u2019s purview per statute. Specifically, pursuant to Labor Code \u00a75305, the Division of Workers' Compensation, including the administrative director, and the appeals board have jurisdiction over all controversies arising out of injuries suffered outside the territorial limits of this state in those cases where the injured employee is a resident    </span>    <span style=\"letter-spacing:0.1pt\">     of    </span>    <span>     this state at the time of the injury and the contract of hire was made in this state. This case, falls directly under Labor Code \u00a75305 because it involves an issue as whether a contract of hire was made in this state.    </span>   </p>   <p style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:36pt; text-align:justify; line-height:20.75pt\">    <span>     Defendant cites    </span>    <span style=\"font-style:italic\">     14 Penn Plaza LLC v.

Moreover as stated above, this refers to terms and conditions of employment, which does not include contract formation or subject matter jurisdiction.

For the reasons stated \nbelow, we agree with the latter recommendat ion and do not adopt or incorporate the former.    \nWe are not persuaded  that the record supports the allowance of a credit for overpayment \nof TD.  The WCJ relie s on the December 15, 2020 pain management panel qualified medical \nexamination report of Lawrenc e Miller, M.D., to allow the credit.  Dr. Miller found applicant to \nhave reached maximum medical improvement.  (Dr. Miller\u2019s 12/15/20 report, at p. 13, defendant\u2019s \nExhibit D.)  However, the signature page of Dr. Miller\u2019s December 15, 2020 report is undated, the  \nattached  proof of service is  undated and unsigned, and  what appears to be a facsimile stamp at the \nbottom of each page of the report states \u201c12/31/2020 12:00:00 AM .\u201d Thus, there does not appear \nto be evidence that the report was transmitted prior to December 31, 2020.

Thus, the applicant  had completed the requested 6 sessions of \nacupuncture by Dr. Kalve, and was beginning the requested PT by Dr. Kalve, that had been authorized. \nIn a September 18, 2020 report, Dr. Kalve indicates that \u201cadditional\u201d PT was being requested, but \nno amount was listed in the report. Further, no information is provided as to whether the applicant had already completed her 12 sessions of authorized PT at that time. \nIn October 9, 2020, Dr. Kalve reports that the applicant finished her 12 PT sessions, and under \n\u201cPlan ,\u201d indicated that the applicant was referred to pain management, and that \u201cAdditional PT has \nbeen appealed.\u201d Defense Exhibit D, page 11.

Minutes of Hearing and Summary of Evidence, August 16, 2023, page 3, lines 9- 10. Pursuant to EAMS, EDD filed and served their \nopening lien on March 11, 2021 on defendant. Given tha t this judge found that the applicant was Permanent and Stationary on December 15, \n2020, and pursuant to the stipulations at trial, defendant issued PD benefits from January 1, 2021 through October 28, 2021 to the applicant, it was found that EDD was entit led to reimbursement. \nThis was based on that there had been no evidence submitted by defendant that they had advised EDD that they were issuing PD benefits during the time EDD issued their benefits.  \nAccordingly, it was found that defendant was liable to ED D for the duplicative period paid, at the \nweekly rate of $290.00, when the applicant was receiving PD benefits. Specifically, EDD paid the \napplicant for 43 weeks, which when multiplied by the PD rate of $290.00, results in $12,470.00 \nowed to EDD by defenda nt, including interest.  \nDefendant argues in their \u201cPetition for Reconsideration and/or Removal,\u201d that the EDD representative Mr. Bill Helrigel, contacted defense counsel, Mr. Ali Vassigh, on October 6, \nregarding the Findings, Award and Order that had issue d, and advised that no money was owed to \nEDD, because they had been paying a \u201cdifferential\u201d during the time period in question. \u201cPetition \nfor Reconsideration and/or Removal,\u201d page 4, lines 5- 9.

It was one to two years earlier that she began her position as a customer billing resolution specialist where her job was mostly administrative \nconsisting of computer data entry. Id at p. 2, lines 11- 14. Additionally, on direct examination, \nshe testified that she d eveloped pain in her neck in approximately 2012 and her mid back in 2011 \nor 2012. Id . at p. 2, lines 15- 16. \nFurthermore, pain in her right shoulder returned in February, 2020, id . at page 3, lines 12 -13, by \ndefendant\u2019s own admission. During cross -examinati on the applicant was shown a claim form \nreflecting that it was returned on October 8, 2020. Id . at page 3, lines 14- 15. Much of the \ndefendant\u2019s denial of this claim rests on the fact that the applicant had an intervening, \nnonindustrial motor vehicle accident on September 18, 2020. Id . at page 3, line 16. Before that \naccident, however, the applicant  testified that she self -procured treatment for her right shoulder. \nId. at page 3, lines 14- 16. Subsequent to the motor vehicle accident, the applicant treated for pain \nto her cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, right shoulder, and for headaches, as reflected in the medical report of Dr. Garcia. Id . at page 3, lines 16- 19. Dr. Garcia\u2019s history is that the \napplicant\u2019s right shoulder pain had full function, and that the motor vehicle accident is the sole cause of her condition. Id . at page 3, line 20- 24. This claim was settled for bodily injury in the \namount of $6,500. Id . at page 4, lines 9- 10. \nBolstering the defendant\u2019s denial is that the applicant, on July 7, 2014, was involved in a motor \nvehicle accident with injuries and complaints to both lower  extremities, lower abdomen, left arm, \nbreast area, right ankle, collar bone, both shoulders, chest, and neck. (Exhibits 2 and 3, Kaiser  \nrecords).

The \ndoctor also took a history of a 2011 industrial injury to her hands, a 2013 industrial injury to her \nright shoulder, a slip and fall injury at Costco (date unrecalled), and a December 2020 motor vehicle accident (page 3). She was taken off work from April 30, 2021 through September, 2021 \ndue to lung cancer (page 2), but at the time of the evaluation on February 10, 2022 she had \nreturned to her regular work duties, consisting of a 40- hour work week with daily sitting, \nstanding, walking, twisting, and turning, and repetitive use of her hands for gripping, grasping, and typing (page 2).  \nThe PQME reviewed the Kaiser records that, inter alia, dealt with the July 7, 2014 motor vehicle accident and the October 15, 2014 dog -walking injury. Although the applicant reporte d that the \ndate of the 2020 nonindustrial motor vehicle accident occurred in December 2020, the PQME noted on page 21 that it occurred on September 18, 2020 and referenced it as a \u201c[s]ignificant \nmotor vehicle accident\u201d. He was therefore made aware of this as evidenced by his review of the medical report of Dr. Alfred Garcia dated September 28, 2020 where he incorporated a history of \nbeing rear -ended and then pushed into the car in front of her, causing injury to her neck, right \nshoulder, collarbone, low bac k, and headaches.

In short, \nthe PQME had a full and complete history of all the  applicant\u2019s medical conditions and injuries, \nwhich caused him to arrive at his conclusion of an industrial injury to her cervical spine and right wrist.

(Exhibit J3) The PQME did not change any of his opinions. \nOn November 4, 2022, the defendant initiated the PQME\u2019s cross -examination (Exhibit J4). Dr. \nHamada conceded that the applicant did not volunteer her July 2014 motor vehicle acci dent or \nthat she injured her hip, left wrist, and right knee in a domestic violence incident. He was aware \nthat she had a right shoulder injury in 2013 but had no medical records. The doctor, however, \nalso testified that the applicant\u2019s memory was foggy an d that it was important to note that she \nhas stage 4 carcinoma of the cecum with frequent headaches. After presenting various inconsistencies throughout her medical records and deposition testimony, in an effort to change \nhis mind and conclude that the applicant did not sustain a cumulative trauma injury, the PQME \nrefused to do so. Specifically, although Dr. Hamada called into question the applicant\u2019s \ncredibility, he nonetheless concluded \u201c\u2026that if the applicant\u2019s credibility was proven to be \nuntrue\u2026\u201d his opinion as to causation \u201c\u2026would change, but how much it would depend upon \n[his] understanding of the documents\u2026\u201d from AAA auto club sent to him.

Furthermore, because of the applicant\u2019s stage 4 cancer and the defendant calling into \nquestion the applicant\u2019s credibility, the doctor recommended a neuropsyche consult with \nneurocognitive battery testing and an MRI of her brain. He also recommended an MRI of her \nright shoulder and an MRI of her left wrist. The neuropsyche consult with neurocognitive battery \ntesting was warranted, in his opinion, to determine  if the applicant had cognitive dysfunction, \nand if not, then she would have a serious credibility problem. The specific testimony elicited from the PQME on page 20, line 19 to page 21, line 11 surrounding the neuropsyche consult \nwith neurocognitive battery testing is as follows:  \nQ Why would that be necessary in this case?  \nA It would go to clarify why she has made different statements at different times. \nIf she is found to have post -tumor changes cognitively of her brain either due to her \nmetastatic lesion or stress or whatever, that's outside of my specialty.  \nQ So if the neuro consult showed no kind of cognitive dysfunction, then you would \nagree the applicant has a serious credibility problem; correct?  \nA Yes.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2654, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "680a7964-3a1b-4ff9-86c9-0396346bc480": {"__data__": {"id_": "680a7964-3a1b-4ff9-86c9-0396346bc480", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Cabral,  Christina.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Cabral,  Christina.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 360134, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "51515909-6f19-407b-9aa3-d79eb8d67e7e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Cabral,  Christina.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Cabral,  Christina.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 360134, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "02775af19e5c975f52bf037f18403bf5e48bc6b54bf5de75d8afa1dfdc97674e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0b255d49-a7ba-4f5b-a395-bed503128203", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Cabral,  Christina.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Cabral,  Christina.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 360134, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "1905e0c6e2f1daf23f530990afc7a54848f0db21f86e720613104435af6252c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "753aec0d-865c-4210-9f01-71d2228225c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7addb53f2a429768a392abd43f34b9b4651cbf24da3eb81f6f533c161a7eea8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6786223390cbb78eb2933715565f504bf61b2463e57ab37bc3b668ee6b82b779", "text": "7 \n Q And before you did all this other additional testing, wouldn't it be appropriate to \nhave a judge make a determination on whether there's even industrial causation on \nthis case before that additional testing is done? \nA I think that's a legal issue.

The defendant posits that because the \napplicant\u2019s work-related right shoulder injury from July 2013 was fully resolved, that because her claim form from her February 2020 reported injury was returned to her employer in October \n2020, that because she had a motor vehicle accident on September 18, 2020, and that because she \nhad injuries on August 25, 2006, July 7, 2014, and October 15, 2014, it must necessarily be the \ncase that the applicant intended to deceive t he defendant and thus must not prevail. The \ndefendant\u2019s theory is flawed. We know that the applicant had an admitted right shoulder injury at work in July 2013. We also \nknow that she has had several nonindustrial injuries. On top of this, however, we know that she \nreported an injury to SCE in February 2020 but did not return the claim form given to her until \nOctober 2020. The court does not find it a coincidence that she returned the claim form in the \nmonth following her September 18, 2020. And the court cannot ignore the history provided to \nthe PQME by the applicant that she provided a history of that motor vehicle accident occurring \nin December 2020. But the defendant\u2019s theory that she has intentionally misled the PQME into \nfinding in her favor is misplaced. The PQME evaluated the applicant in February 2021. Whether \nshe reported to him that the motor vehicle accident occurred in September 2020 versus \nDecember 2020 is irrelevant. What is crucial is whether the doctor had, at the time of hos \nevaluation in February 2021, by any means, an accurate history of the September 18, 2020 motor \nvehicle accident.

After review of further records pertaining to the September 18, 2020 motor vehicle accident, the PQME did not change \nhis opinion. And after cross -examination, the PQME left open the door of only possibly \nchanging his opinion. Although defendant argues that the doctor did so, the undersigned does not find that to be so. The PQME specifically testified that the applicant has stage 4 cancer, \nheadaches,  and a foggy memory. As a nod to the defendant\u2019s efforts, the PQME said his opinion \nmay change if further records from AAA were sent to him, and if the applicant underwent a neuropsyche consult with neurocognitive  battery testing and an MRI of her brain where the \nresults demonstrated no cognitive dysfunction. No such records were sent, no such consult was had, and no such testing was performed. Accordingly, there is no supplemental report or any \nkind of evidence from the PQME changing his mind as to causati on \u2013 because the defendant \nopted to file a DOR instead.

But that was not done. Had the defendant \nopted for that route, this case may be presented differently. Instead, however, the defendant did \nnot do what the PQME stated was necessary, and instead filed a DOR under penalty of perjury \nthat they were presently ready to proceed to hearing, on the very same day of the cross -\nexamination seeking a Priority Conference and a trial on AOE/COE.  \nAt the time of trial, the applicant was found credible when test ifying that she was hired as a \nphone representative in June 2003 and was later promoted to a customer billing resolution specialist in either 2011 or 2012, a position she worked until her last day in either April or May \nof 2022. She credibly testified that  her job as a billing specialist was such that she worked mostly \nat a desk, on a computer.

(Opinion on Decision, at pp. 4- 5.)  \nApplicant contends that his one season played for the Oakland Athletics qualifies as \n\u201cregularly working\u201d in California, thus conferring subject matter jurisdiction under section \n3600.5(a). Applicant further contends that the conferral of subject matter jur isdiction under section \n3600.5(a) obviates the entirety of the WCJ\u2019s analysis of section 3600.5(d).  \nThe WCJ\u2019s Report observes that applicant played but one season out of eleven for a \nCalifornia -based team, and that applicant\u2019s duty days played for a California team were less than \nthe 20 percent threshold of section 3600.5(d). (Report, at p. 2.) The WCJ f urther observes that the \nterm \u201cregularly working\u201d as used in 3600.5(a) encompasses applicant\u2019s entire professional career, \nand that the \u201cduty days\u201d calculation of section 3600.5(d)(1)(A) contemplates work for California \nbased teams.

LEXIS 292] , a panel of the Appeals Board determined:  \n[E]ven where there is general statutory subject -matter over a claim, and where \nthere are sufficient connections between the injury and the State of California to support the exercise of jurisdiction, the claims of professional athletes are subject to specific statutory exemptions, codified in section 3600.5, subdivisions \n(c) and (d). (\u00a7 3600.5(c) & (d).) These subdivisions are not grants of statutory subject -matter jurisdiction themselves; rather, they serve to limit the general \ngrants of statutory subject -matter jurisdiction for certain claims by professional \nathletes.   (Farley, supra, at p. 4.)  \nIn Wilson v. Florida Marlins  (February 26, 2020, ADJ10779733) [2020 Cal. Wrk. Comp. \nP.D. LEXIS 30], a panel of the Appeals Board discussed the legislative intent with respect to the \n2013 amendments to section 3600.5:  \nThe Legislature appears to have been mainly concerned with athletes who were \nnot hired in this state, who were filing claims and recovering benefits under the law as it existed prior to Johnson based upon a small handful of games. The reference to Bowen de monstrates the Legislature recognized and approved of \nthe long- standing principle of California law, stretching back close to a century, \nthat a contract of hire in California is itself a compelling connection to the state that validates the exercise of jur isdiction. (See Alaska Packers Asso. v. Industrial \nAcci. Com.  (1934) 1 Cal.2d 250, 261- 262, 34 P.2d 716.) If a hire in California \nduring the injury period is a compelling connection to the state, by definition such athletes would not fall into the category of those with \"extremely minimal California contacts\" whose claims the Legislature sought to exempt. If the Legislature had intended to depart from the position that California will exercise jurisdiction over a claim if the applicant was hired in Californ ia, we think the \nLegislature, would clearly have said as much, and, at a minimum, would not have reaffirmed that principle by referencing Bowen.  \n This reading of the statute is also supported by the nature of subdivisions (c) and (d), both of which reference a 20% threshold for determining the strength of an", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2808, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4644764d-c2df-49b6-8f09-b1ffcb228ca7": {"__data__": {"id_": "4644764d-c2df-49b6-8f09-b1ffcb228ca7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Davis,  Isaac.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Davis,  Isaac.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 302210, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "312fe193-1c64-4072-912d-379ca76a3d12", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Davis,  Isaac.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Davis,  Isaac.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 302210, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "b0a5604a26ef7708d197b2da165f92f887a15248697d58b5926df80a5ef1576c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f098c8c-5afb-43cd-bb80-0a3cda2b3ff3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Davis,  Isaac.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Davis,  Isaac.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 302210, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "4a024d3bde89ea2377410aa9291046877df385b832fb41e326619199ac80f153", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1211fdd9-67a5-41a8-94f3-44b77f4186e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "902998c930af2671055ccb6b391ee0954d6b88eaf45346bc57770fe4b37f327b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "77522124f9efa306b86cbb6946f34176c0847a6a39db0fe8bb2624556ab57d48", "text": "4 \n injured athlete's connection to the state.

(Wilson, supra, at pp. 17- 18.) \nHere, we must consider whether the statutory grant of jurisdiction for employees \u201cregularly \nworking\u201d in California is sufficient to obviate consideration of subsections (c) and (d) of section \n3600.5. Our prior jurisprudence has addressed the jurisdictional implications of a contract of hire \nformed within California\u2019s territorial jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (a). However, we must consider the question of whether a professional athlete who has not entered into a California \ncontract of hire but was none theless regularly working in California must overcome the \nrequirements of subsection (d) as a prerequisite to  the exercise of California subject matter \njurisdiction.  \nDecisions of the Appeals Board \u201cmust be based on admitted evidence in the \nrecord.\u201d  (Hamilton v.

Applicant argued that Dr. Sirujallah should \nreview records. Yet there has been no attempt to send further records to the PQME, again a lack of due diligen ce for 5 years. Applicant has not treated \nsince the one  time evaluation with Dr. Russman on 1/7/19. If there was \ndiscovery to be had, it should have been had years ago, not now in 2023. The same argument goes for the request for a panel in psyche. If the applicant\u2019s attorney knew about this in 2018 according to the orthopedic \nPQME\u2019s recommendation, and even the treating doctor Russman did not mention it in January 2019, there  was no treatment or request for additional \npanel, petition, DOR, once applicant\u2019s attorney filed their petition back on 5/15/2019. It is not the WCAB\u2019s job to rescue a case when there has been no action or discovery for years, a lack of due diligence or lack on applicant\u2019s part and/or applicant\u2019s treating doctor(s) (Russman or any of th e \nother provides like the acupuncturist in March 2019) to request the referral. The psyche was not claimed, it was not mentioned by Dr. Russman, who came AFTER the 2018 PQME in orthopedics, and so I cannot and do not", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2571, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e4af34a-71a8-44b5-8c97-1045ade0beac": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e4af34a-71a8-44b5-8c97-1045ade0beac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Fractious,  Erika.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Fractious,  Erika.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 357551, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f8afd96f-4368-4ed3-930b-7fa101ea2587", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Fractious,  Erika.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Fractious,  Erika.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 357551, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "6431969202ee13d5529588c1aa50f18e3fdda08b937aee9cc2620109d7956d6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a55366b5-e10f-4921-ab46-bbcd011b7899", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Fractious,  Erika.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Fractious,  Erika.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 357551, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "0f403a4140bdac47fc7bb86d0f257b42334ea6b4aebda1b7a7c289bfb9048e63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "16194309-2c72-4af6-a70c-beff10b45a13", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "604823035621c55de789ab17f88d679cad8844eaa47d378f46f88fbd8f049af3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b6c74a83ecfc74ede0fdf900f140e69ae6c7d3336d6b8bbd05064d261fb4476c", "text": "4 \n find \u201cgood cause\u201d to order additional discovery via an additional panel in \npsyche.  \n(Opinion on Decision, pp. 2- 3.)   \n \nOn July 18, 2023, the  trial court served courtesy cop ies of the F&O upon the following \nparties:  \nERIKA FRACTIOUS    Injured Worker, 1850 S DIAMOND BAR BLVD APT 808 \nDIAMOND   BAR CA 91765    \n FLOYD SKEREN PASADENA   Law Firm, 3835R E THOUSAND OAKS BLVD \nPMB 630 WESTLAKE VILLAGE CA 91362, pas -serve@fsklaw.com   \n MARRIOTT HOT SPRINGS       Claims Administrator, PO BOX 14238 \nLEXINGTON KY 40512  \n TELLERIA TELLERIA SAN GABRIEL    Law Fi rm, 828 W LAS TUNAS \nDR SAN GABRIEL CA 91776  \n(Proof of Service of Courtesy Copy of Findi ngs and Order, July 18, 2023.)  \n \nOn September 6, 2023, defendant filed its proof of service of the F&O.

Even then, it was well beyond 25 da ys, and therefore the \nPetition is untimely.  \n. . . The main issue is Applicant demanding a psychological panel QME as a second panel in the case.  \n. . . The applicant's DWC -1 Claim Form did not list \"psyche\". Dr. Russman did \nnot note any psyche complaints, despite the fact her exam was already over 6 months since applicant left her employment and was working at Benchmark. Dr. Russman diagnosed her with right shoulder pain and some vague muscle contracture.  \n. . .

Workers' Comp. Appeals Board (Phillips ) (1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 1, \n3-4 [43 Cal.Comp.Cases 1193].)  \nHere, the record shows that on Jul y 18, 2023, the WCJ mailed  a courtesy copy of the F&O \nto 1850 S outh Diamond Bar, but to apartment number 808, not apartment 804 as provided by the \nOAR .  (Proof of Service of Courtesy Copy of Findings and Order, July 18, 2023.)  On September \n6, 2023, defend ant mailed a copy of the F&O to  1850 South Diamond Bar, apartment 804, as \nprovided by  applicant\u2019s OAR .  (Proof of Service of Findings and Order, Revised, September 7, \n2023.)   However,  defendant \u2019s Answer  asserts that this  copy went undelivered.   (Answer, p. 2:12-\n14.)    \n  Hence, because the original  service of the F&O was defective,  because the initial attempt \nto serve a copy of the F&O was defective,  and because defendant asserts that the copy of the F&O  \nit mailed to applicant at her OAR  went undelivered,  there are no grounds to conclude that applicant \nreceived the F&O.  Accordingly, we  will treat the Petition as timely  and evaluate its  merits.  \n Applicant contends that the WCJ erroneously failed to order an additional panel in \npsychiatry ; and, in consequence, failed to find that applicant sustained injury to her psyche .  \nSpecifically, applicant contends that the WCJ effectively den ied discovery on the claimed psyche \ninjury by  denying  her request  for an additional panel in psychiatry  on the  spurious  grounds that \nshe had  not allege d a psyche injury  and not diligently prosecuted her putative psyche  claim.         \nHere, as stated in the Opinion on Decision and the Report, the WCJ opined  that applicant \nhad not demonstrated good cause for an additional pa nel in psychiatry because she had not allege d \na psyche injury  and had otherwise  delayed prosecution of her claim.  (Opinion on Decision, pp. 2-\n3; Report, pp. 1- 4.) \nBut the pleadings record reveals that (1) the application for adjudication did include  a \npsyche injury claim ; and (2) the parties did not frame the issue of whether applicant\u2019s claim should \nbe dismissed for failure to prosecute  as one for trial.  (Application for Adjudication, October 24, \n2018, p. 9; Minutes of Hearing and Summary of Evidence, January 25, 2023, pp. 2:17- 3:13.)  It \nfollows that  the finding that no good cause exists for  an additional panel in psychiatry  is without \nsupport .   \nAdditionally, we are persuaded that  the WCJ should have determined whether  good cause \nexists for an add itional panel in psychiatry , an issue  pending  in this matter  since May 15, 2019, \nbefore  holding a hearing on the issue of whether applicant sustained injury to the psyche.

This court issued its Findings and \nOrder and Opinion on Decision 10/20/2023. \nPetitioner has filed a timely, verified 10 -page Petition for Reconsideration (hereinafter \n\u201cPetition\u201d or \u201cPetition For Reconsideration\u201d) which includes references to evidentiary matters and \ntrial exhibits. The Petition lacks citations to the trial record, in violation of Title 8, California Code \nof Regulations Section 10945 (b).) \nThe essence of the Petition is: 1) The WCALJ found applicant has not sustained his burden \nof proving a right to reopen; 2) The WCALJ erroneously relied on the medical findings of the \nPQMEs (Dr. Hannani and Dr. Caren) rather than those of the Primary Treating Physician \n(Dr. Haronian) and Secondary Physician (Dr. Majcher); 3) The WCALJ should have concluded \nthat the medical findings of the Primary Treating Physician and Secondary Physician (Dr. Haronian and Dr. Majcher) were more persuasive than the medical f indings of the PQMEs \nand Consulting Neurologist (Dr. Hannani, Dr. Caren & Dr. Aminian). \nI \nINTRODUCTION \nAs noted in this court\u2019s Opinion on Decision, the \u201c\u2026fulcrum issue was whether Applicant \nsuffered new and further disability such that he is entitled to reopen this case\u2026\u201d (Opinion On Decision 10/20/2023, page 5.) Upon this fulcrum issue, the court determined Applicant bore the \nburden of proof and that Applicant did not sustain his burden of proving a right to reopen. (Opinion \nOn Decision 10/20/2023, page 7.) In reaching this determination, the court relied upon the findings \nof Panel Qualified Medical Evaluators Kambiz Hannani (Orthopedics) and Jeffrey Caren (Internal \nMedicine). The court found the medical reporting of Drs. Caren and Hannani to be substantial, \nreliable, well -reasoned and persuasive. Drs. Caren and Hannani concluded the Applicant did not \nsuffe r new and further disability. \nAt trial, the parties stipulated that Drs. Hannani and Caren were the duly selected Qualified \nMedical Evaluators. (MOH/SOE 9/12/2023, page 2:23-24.) Dr. Kevin Aminian served the parties as a Secondary Consulting Physician in Neurology.

Without citation \neither to the record or the Guides, Petitioner contends that the \u201c\u2026Guides require that the physician \nexaminer take the average of three readings to determine the impairment rating\u2026\u201d (Petition For \nReconsideration, page 5:4-6.) \nDr. Hannani provided measurements and his measurements were similar to those of Dr. \n Haronian. The Guides, however, do not categorially require that the physician examiner \ntake three readings in all situations. By way of example, measurements of passive range of motion \nmay not be required at all.  \nThe Guides acknowledge that \u201c\u2026In determining the range of motion of individual joints, \nthe examiner must evaluate both the active and the passive motion. Active or voluntary motion is \nthat performed by the active contraction of the governing muscles and is evaluated first. When a person has full active joint excursion, passive motion values need not to be taken because a joint \nthat has full active excursion will have a full passive range as well\u2026\u201d ( Guides To the Evaluation \nof Permanent Impairment , 5th Ed., page 451.) \nDr. Hannani examined Applicant\u2019s shoulders and found the range of motion entirely within \nnormal limits (right/left forward flexion 180; Extension 50; Abduction 180; Adduction 50; External Rotation 90; Internal Rotation 90; all compared to normal and found normal).

Given these entirely normal \nfindings, passive  measurements are not required.  \nIt is also noteworthy that Dr. Hannani found the shoulders to be nonindustrial body parts \nbut still provided measurements. (Exhibit B, Medical Report of Dr. Kambiz Hannani, 4/29/2015, \npage 4.)  \nThe court is mindful that, when commenting upon measurements of various body parts to \ndetermine consistency, the Guides indicate the physician \u201cshould\u201d take measurements. Dr. Hannani did take measurements. The Guides note that \u201c\u2026repeating measurements may decrease \nerror and result in a measurement that is closer to average function\u2026\u201d (Guides To the Evaluation \nof Permanent Impairment, 5th Ed., page 20.) The physician may of course disregard the \nmeasurements. The AMA Guides specify that \u201c\u2026measurements, such a s one that checks the \nindividual\u2019s lumbosacral spine range of motion (Section 15.9) are good but imperfect indicators of people\u2019s efforts.

With regard to the \nlower back, however, there is complete Orthopedic agreement. Both Dr. Hannani and Dr. Haronian \nconcur that the lower back was not injured as a result of the specific  injury which is the subject of \nthis Petition to Reopen. Dr. Haronian attributes 60% of the applicant\u2019s lower back condition to a cumulative trauma working for a subsequent employer and 40% to nonindustrial factors. (Exhibit \n1, Follow Up Report of A Primar y Treating Physician, records of SCIF page 180 of 223.) Dr. \nHannani likewise finds the lower back nonindustrial, noting: \u201c\u2026He is claiming his low back, as well as his  shoulders; however, the documentation at Kaiser for about one year following the injury \ndoes NOT document any low back complaints. \u2026Furthermore, the only documentation of shoulder complaints appears to be a radiating pain to the shoulders, as documented by  physical \ntherapy in March and April 2014.

The Defendant employer in this proceeding is Ontario Automotive, LLC dba Penske \nHonda  Ontario (hereinafter \u201cPenske\u201d).  The Applicant began working for Penske on 10/29/2010. \n(Exhibit J.)  The only injury which is the subject of Petitioner\u2019s Petition to Reopen is Applicant\u2019s \nspecific injury which occurred 4/15/2013. Although the Applicant\u2019s employment as an automobile \nporter  with Penske technically ended 4/15/2013, he kept his uniforms, lock box keys and alarm \nremote. (Exhibit J.) He transitioned to employment with a company called Parking Corporation \nperforming the same duties at the same site.  \nThe Applicant worked through Parking Corporation from May 2013 to January 2015. His \nwork duties for Parking Corporation continued to be those of an automobile porter. His duties \nincluded washing and detailing vehicles, vacuuming interiors, driving vehicles  to different \ndealerships to trade, and parking vehicles in the lot. His activities continued to require extensive standing and walking, as well as constant maneuvering of his hands and arms, driving, bending, \nstooping, squatting, twisting, turning, pushing,  and pulling, gripping,  and grasping, reaching to all \nlevels, lifting,  and carrying buckets of soap and water weighing up to 30 pounds.

The Applicant\u2019s \ncondition relating to his 2013 injury at Penske was quantified in November 2016. On 11/15/2016 \nthis specific injury claim against Penske was settled via stipulated Award providing for 29% \npermanent disability related to the head and neck. All other body parts were dismissed. Petitioner \nseeks to reopen the Award based on new and further di sability occurring after November 2016 \n(when the Award issued). \nPetitioner argues without citing to the record that Dr. Hannani incorrectly believed \nApplicant last worked for Penske in January 2015 when in fact Applicant last worked for Penske in April 2013. Petitioner omits that the Applicant continued to perform the same duties at the same \nsite, arguably with Penske as a dual employer. Hence, a distinction without a difference.

Any shared misapprehensions by physicians as to whether the \nApplicant technically stopped working for Penske in January 2013 or April 2015, is harmless, \ninconsequential and lacks relevance to the issues before this court or the court\u2019s findings thereon. \nThe focal period is the period from the November 2016 Award and thereafter.  \nPetitioner contends that \u201c\u2026defendant did not submit any updated records from Kaiser \n(where Applicant treated on a private basis) for Dr. Hannani to review.

WCJ Erroneously relied on Dr. Caren\u2019s reporting \nbecaus e case law has established that the reporting of a secondary treater may still be \nadmissible even  though the primary treating physician did not incorporate a secondary \ntreater\u2019s findings.  \n \nPetitioner contends, without citation to the trial record, that \u201c\u2026the WCJ provided Dr. \nMajcher\u2019s reporting cannot be relied on because it was not incorporated by Primary Treating Physician (PTP) Dr. Haronian\u2026\u201d (Petition For Reconsideration, page 7:26- 28.) \nPetitioner adds \u201c\u2026the appeals board held that reports of secondary treating physicians were \nadmissible even if they were not reviewed and incorporated by the primary treating physician\u2026\u201d \n(Petition For Reconsideration, page 7:17- 19.) \nPetitioner concludes \u201c\u2026the fact that Dr. Majcher\u2019s findings were not incorporated does not \nobviate the admissibility of Dr. Majcher\u2019s reporting, especially because it was reviewed by Dr.  \nHaronian\u2026\u201d (Petition For Reconsideration, page 8:11- 14.) \nContrary to Petitioner\u2019s contention, the court did not rely on the findings of Dr. Caren, either \nin whole or in part, because it questioned the inadmissibility of Dr. Majcher\u2019s reporting for failure of incorporation. To the contrary, Dr. Macher\u2019s reporting was entered into evidence. Dr. Majcher\u2019s \nreporting was carefully weighed, considered, and commented upon by this court.  \nThe court did make note of Dr. Haronian\u2019s disparate commentary relating to two other \nSecondary Consulting Physicians vs. his commentary related to Secondary Consulting Physician Dr. Majcher. The court\u2019s commentary related to the court\u2019s duty to weigh the evidence not to any issue \nof admissibility.  \nIn weighing the reporting of Dr. Majcher against that of QME Caren, this court observed that \nDr. Haronian concurred with the findings of Dr. Aminian and Dr. Hinze and adopted them as his \nown.

He did not similarly adopt the findings of Dr. Stanley  \nMajcher . (Exhibit 7, Permanent and Stationary Medical Report of Dr. Edwin Haronian dated \n4/20/2022, page 32 of 35.)  \nThe basis upon which the court found the reporting of Dr. Caren to be more persuasive than \nthat of Dr. Majcher was entirely unrelated to any issue of admissibility of Dr. Majcher\u2019s reporting.  \nPETITIONER\u2019S CONTENTION e: WCJ erroneously relied on Dr. Caren\u2019s reporting because his opinions are predicated on an inadequate medical history.  \n In support of this contention, Petitioner asserts \u201c\u2026Dr. Caren\u2019s opinions are based on \nincomplete information because there were no records reviewed prior to Applicant\u2019s employment at Penske establishing use of hypertensive medications and dosage\u2026\u201d (Petitio n For Reconsideration, \npage 8:21 -24.)  \nThe Applicant began working for this employer on or around 10/20/10.

A basis upon which the Applicant asserts a \nright to reopen is injury to additional body parts, including hypertension and coronary artery disease.  \nPetitioner contends that QME Dr. Caren\u2019s opinions are flawed because he did not review \nrecords predating 2010. Petitioner contends the conclusions of Dr. Stanley Majcher (an internist) are more substantial than those of Dr. Caren (Diplomate, American Board  of Internal Medicine and \nCardiovascular Disease).  \nThe court respectfully disagrees. Dr. Caren conducted and provided an extensive 42 -page \nrecord review, which included a review of each other\u2019s reporting.  \nDr. Caren\u2019s reporting included a 42- page record review section. The records which were \nprovided to both Dr. Caren and Dr. Majcher included medical records pre -dating the 2013 injury and \nrecords pre -dating the Applicant\u2019s 2010 commencement of employment with Penske. Both Dr. \nCaren and Majcher concluded that Applicant had a longstanding history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease predating Applicant\u2019s employment with Penske.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2494, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b72d89aa-a45c-4616-a35e-1c8916622923": {"__data__": {"id_": "b72d89aa-a45c-4616-a35e-1c8916622923", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "Lujan Gonzalez, David.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Lujan Gonzalez, David.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99ff2b8e-d618-460a-a8c9-cb5081303d2c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "Lujan Gonzalez, David.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Lujan Gonzalez, David.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "19f1e5d1825c8ddaae9d5d624b01980e815f93ff8863619a3c8ebb860b5689c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2eda2ab6-58f8-490d-87dc-587eb5999651", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "Lujan Gonzalez, David.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Lujan Gonzalez, David.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "2a28024d0656971600e55a213711a3c606af99447051a4c9ef396a42bb05669c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "61044e03-b898-43b0-87bd-939954b4c927", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8cdcb518c150699f55103fe32b8f9da76029074e78a8f116e149327f9eb9bfa1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "16541e598b060ec677561ac4b874ac8b493a4cc9cbc2ed9de15ae91ff8046cb2", "text": "24 \n The Applicant worked for this employer for a period of approximately 3 years prior to his \n2013 injury.

(Ex F, Medical \nReport of Dr. Jeffrey Caren dated 8/10/2021, pages 9- 42.)  \nA multitude of records pertaining to preexisting hypertension and cardiovascular problems \npredating the Applicant\u2019s injury of 2013 form the basis for the similar diagnoses reached both by Dr.  \nCaren and Dr. Majcher.

The specific injury occurred in 2013, not 2010. There is an abundance of records reviewed by Dr. Caren predating 2013.  \nThe diagnostic determinations of Dr. Caren and Dr. Majcher do not significantly differ. The \ncourt has again reviewed the 58 -page medical reporting of Dr. Jeffrey Caren, which includes but is \nnot limited to a detailed and extensive history and 42- page recor d review.

Dr. Majcher diagnosed \nApplicant at the time with \u201cprobable acute myocardial infarction\u201d. Dr. Caren confirmed that \nApplicant suffered an \u201cacute coronary event\u201d while he was having an internal medicine consultation \nwith Dr. Majcher. Not only was t his consultation at the behest of PTP Dr. Haronian, it was also \nauthorized by the defendant. Caselaw is extremely clear that the defendant is responsible for any injuries that occur in the course of medical treatment. Here, Applicant was literally at Dr. M ajcher\u2019s \noffice and had to leave due to a heart attack. Even if the underlying hypertension is deemed nonindustrial, the coronary event occurred during medical treatment and should be found industrial. \nThus, Dr. Caren\u2019s opinion that the heart attack is nonindustrial does not constitute substantial \nmedical evidence because it is based on incorrect legal theory. \u201d (Petition For Reconsideration, page \n9:19- 10:4.)  \nPetitioner\u2019s stated opinions on causation of the heart attack, offered without citation to the  \nrecord, are unsupported by the trial record.  \nThe court has already noted its reasons for finding Dr. Majcher\u2019s reporting unsubstantial. \nIndulging however in an assessment of Dr. Majcher\u2019s reporting as it relates to the heart attack, he does not specify that the heart attack was caused, aggravated,  or accelerated by any industrial \ncondition or treatment.

Defendant denies the injury arose out of and in the \ncourse of employment . \nMohan Nair, M.D., in his capacity as orthopedic QME, evaluated applicant on December \n13, 2021, and issued a corresponding report. (Ex. B, Report of Mohan Nair, M.D., January 6, 2022, \nat p. 2.) Therein, Dr. Nair noted his receipt and review of 2,440 pages of medical records. The \nQME determined that \u201c the reasonable medical probability is that Mr. Oriarte \u2019s current bilateral \nleg/knee impairment is caused by the 08/10/2017 industrial injury,\u201d  and that applicant should be \nreevaluated following bilateral knee sur gery and physical therapy. ( Id. at pp. 57, 59.)  \nOn May 25, 2022, defendant undertook the deposition of Dr. Nair . The unrepresented \napplicant was not in attendance at the deposition. Therein, Dr. Nair testified to a change in his \npreviously stated opinions:  \nA.  Yeah, you know, I have a change in my opinion about causation. Yeah, so \nboth those statements on the causation, the reasonable medical probability is \nthat Mr. Oriarte \u2019s current bilateral leg, knee impairment is  caused by the  \n8-10-2017 industrial injury; and the second statement, that there is a \nconsequential injury, ankles, as a result of ambulatory problems, gait \nproblems and obesity, both of those are \u2013  \n   I\u2019m not -- I have change of opinion. I would say that I cannot to a reasonable \nmedical probability state that Mr. Oriarte \u2019s current bilateral leg, knee \nimpairment is caused by the 8- 10-2017 industrial injury. That \u2019s my opinion. \n  Q.  And what \u2019s the reason for the change?  \n  A. Well, you know, --  well, you know, when you prepare for depositions, you \nare compelled to look at the data a lot more carefully or less hastily than you do when you have to prepare a report. And in going through it, it became obvious to me that I have no w ay to identify that Mr. Oriarte in fact had an \ninjury on the day that he claims that he had an injury. And I mean, I did give \nhim the benefit of doubt that it may have happened, but the documentation four days later makes no mention of that. And we have  evidence from Mr. \nOriarte \u2019s own statements that he actually drove to Las Vegas the next day.  \nSo it makes it less credible. I know I \u2019m not the one that has to give an opinion \non the individual \u2019s credibility, but the overall database, including the  initial \nmedical reports of multiple doctors starting with 8 -13-2017, do not \nsubstantiate a knee injury.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2595, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cacbca8f-54ec-4ce2-abdf-35ba7158a4d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "cacbca8f-54ec-4ce2-abdf-35ba7158a4d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Oriarte, Anthony.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Oriarte, Anthony.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 310213, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "93a90c57-a7d9-490e-bcde-bc23ce467ec4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Oriarte, Anthony.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Oriarte, Anthony.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 310213, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "7652a9e48c96b4f0fdab1dcf389ef85b9351391f4f30b131c35a3c533df6885a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7cb24f62-e585-45fc-8e71-ee67dadddf1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Oriarte, Anthony.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Oriarte, Anthony.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 310213, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "520c5c0d71bd37c356b505d46cc453804abf4c8a47b07a90d7d836b27e8eedbd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bbfa1ffc-ab34-4247-8e24-873a042fe796", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "45f8c8b413e7a9606183c01bf7a8278de0222e9479e2af5b54f1abc93dab61ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d56339aec60ee4841a30c0ba19955e44d0396860ae9106a5e8d1c2427b3bebdc", "text": "3 \n  The other thing is the nature of the injury would also be hard to explain, how \nthey could be bilateral problems.

But when I looked more carefully at the records in preparation for this deposition, I could simply find no way to connect an alleged injury on 8- 10-2017 to the subsequent development of his problems \nthat have been extensively identified in the records subsequent to that time. \n (Ex. C, Transcript of the Deposition of Mohan Nair, M.D., May 25, 2022, at  \np. 7:2.)   \n The parties proceeded to trial on July 20, 2023, placing in issue , inter alia, injury \nAOE/COE, and whether the reporting of Dr. Nair constituted substantial medical evidence. \n(Minutes of Hearing (Minutes), July 20, 2023, at p. 2:15.) Following the framing of the issues and \nthe admission of the evidence, the WCJ opined that following his review of the findings of  \nDr. Nair, witness testimony was unnecessary and that he intended to order that  applicant be \nevaluated by an independent medical evaluator. ( Id. at p.  at 4:15.)  \nOn September 27, 2023, the WCJ issued his Findings of Fact and Order. Therein, the WCJ \nfound the \u201c medical opinion of the Qualified Medical Examiner (QME) Dr. Mohan Nair, is not \nsubstantial evidence. \u201d (Finding of Fact No. 4.) The WCJ ordered the Medical Unit to issue a \nreplacement panel of QMEs.  The WCJ \u2019s Opinion explains:  \nHere, Dr. Nair changed his opinion without setting forth proper reasoning in \nsupport of his altered conclusion regarding injury. Instead, he simply states that he has finally been more careful and less hasty in his performing his duties as a QME. In additi on to falling woefully short of constituting substantial evidence \nin this case, this statement from Dr. Nair in his deposition raises the question of whether any of his medical -legal opinions are reliable enough to meet the \nsubstantial evidence standard if  his deposition is never scheduled.  \n (Report, at p. 3.)   \nDefendant \u2019s Petition for Reconsideration (Petition) avers error in the WCJ \u2019s determination \nthat no testimony was necessary, as defendant could not corroborate the medical reporting of  \nDr. Nair with applicant \u2019s testimony.

The WCJ also concludes that additional evidence \nin the record can be evaluated once substantial medical- legal reporting has been adduced , and that \na return to the existing QME in an effort to remedy deficiencies in the reporting would be futile. \n(Ibid.)   \nDISCUSSION  \nIf a decision includes resolution of a \u201c threshold \u201d issue, then it is a \u201c final\u201d decision, whether \nor not all issues are resolved or there is an ultimate decision on the right to benefits. ( Aldi v. Carr, \nMcClellan, Ingersoll, Thompson & Horn (2006) 71 Cal.Comp.Cases 783, 784, fn. 2 (Appeals \nBoard en banc).) Threshold issues include, but are not limited to, the following: injury arising out of and in the course of employment, jurisdiction, the existence of an employment relationship and \nstatute of limitations issues. (See Capital Builders Hardware, Inc. v. Workers \u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd.  \n(Gaona) (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 658, 662 [81 Cal.Comp.Cases 1122].) Failure to timely petition for \nreconsideration of a final decision bars later challenge to the propriety of the decision before the \nWCAB or court of appeal. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7 5904.) Alternatively, non- final decisions may later \nbe challenged by a petition for reconsideration once a final decision issues.  \nA decision issued by the Appeals Board may address a hybrid of both threshold and \ninterlocutory issues. If a party challenges a hybrid decision, the petition seeking relief is treated as a petition for reconsideration because the decision resolves a threshold issue. However, if the \npetitioner challenging a hybrid decision only disputes the WCJ \u2019s determination regarding \ninterlocutory issues, then the Appeals Board will evaluate the issues raised by the petition under the removal standard applicable to non- final decisions. Here, the WCJ \u2019s decision includes a finding \nregarding a threshold issue on employment.

Although the decision contains a finding that is \nfinal, the petitioner is only challenging interlocutory findings/orders in the decision regarding the \ndiscovery dispute. Therefore, we will apply the removal s tandard to our review. (See Gaona, \nsupra.)  \nRemoval is an extraordinary remedy rarely exercised by the Appeals Board. ( Cortez v. \nWorkers \u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 596, 599, fn. 5 [71 Cal.Comp.Cases 155]; \nKleemann v. Workers \u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 274, 280, fn. 2 [70 \nCal.Comp.Cases 133].) The Appeals Board will grant removal only if the petitioner shows that significant prejudice or irreparable harm will result if removal is not granted. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. \n8, \u00a7 10955(a); see also Cortez, supra; Kleemann, supra.) Also, the petitioner must demonstrate \nthat reconsideration will not be an adequate remedy if a final decision adverse to the petitioner ultimately issues. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 10955(a).)  \nDefendant is aggrieved by the WCJ \u2019s determination that the reporting of QME Dr. Nair is \nnot substantial medical evidence and suggests that any perceived deficiencies in the medical \nreport ing, or in the QME \u2019s analysis, should be remedied through directed augmentation of the \nrecord. (Petition, at 6:6.)  \nApplying the removal standard, we find that defendant has not established irreparable harm \nor undue prejudice arising out of the WCJ \u2019s order for a new panel of QMEs. We observe that the \nWCJ has reasonably explained the basis for his decision, and why, in the WCJ \u2019s opinion, the \nmedical -legal conclusions reached by the QME in his deposition are not reliable.  The WCJ \nobserves that the QME has attested to receiving more than 2,400 pages of medical records  and has \nfurther attested to having review ed the medical records as \u201c compiled and arranged \u201d by office \npersonnel. (Ex. B, Report of Mohan Nair, M.D., January 6, 2022, at p. 59.)  In addition, Dr. Nair \u2019s \nreport  states unequivocally that he \u201c reviewed and correlated \u201d the medical records to applicant \u2019s \nhistory, and on that basis, the QME identified injury with industrial causation . (Id. at p. 51.) \nHowever, in a deposition taken outside the presence of the applicant, the QME explained that he had revised his opinions because he was \u201c compelled to look at the data a lot more carefully or less \nhastily than you do when you have to prepare a report .\u201d (Ex.

I would grant defendant \u2019s Petition, rescind Finding of Fact No. 5 \nwhich finds good cause for the issuance of a replacement panel, and amend the Order to direct the \nparties to augment the evidentiary record with Dr. Nair as to his reasoning with respect to \ncausation, and the circumstances surrounding his change in opinion. \n It is well established that any decision, award or order of the Appeals Board must be \nsupported by substantial evidence in light of a review of the entire record. ( Lamb v. Workmen \u2019s \nComp. Appeals Bd. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 274, 281 [ 39 Cal.Comp.Cases 310].) Moreover, the Appeals \nBoard has a constitutional mandate to \u201censure substantial justice in all cases. \u201d  (Kuykendall v. \nWorkers \u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 396, 403 [65 Cal.Comp.Cases 264].)  The \nBoard may not leave matters undeveloped where it is  clear that additional discovery is needed.  \n(Id. at p. 404.)  \n In our en banc decision in McDuffie  v. Los Angeles County Metro. Transit Auth. (2002) 67 \nCal.Comp.Cases 138 [2002 Cal. Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 1218] , we held:  \n[W]here  the WCJ determines after trial or submission of a case for decision that \nthe medical record requires further development, the preferred procedure is to \nallow supplementation of the medical record by the physicians who have already reported in the case. Each side should be allowed the opportunity to obtain \nsupplemental or additional reports and/or  depositions with respect to the area or \nareas requiring further development, i.e., the deficiencies, inaccuracies or lack of completeness previously identified by the WCJ and/or the Board. ( Tyler, \nsupra, 62 Cal. Comp.Cases at p. 928.) Only if the suppleme ntal opinions of the \npreviously reporting physicians do not or cannot cure the need for development of the medical record, should other physicians be considered.  \n (McDuffie supra, at p. 142.)  \n Here, as in McDuffie , the QME should be afforded the opportunity to address the \n\u201cdeficiencies, inaccuracies or lack of completeness, \u201d that are of concern to the WCJ.  Providing the \nevaluating physician with the opportunity to amplify his opinions and to address the WCJ \u2019s \nconcerns allows for the possibility of prompt resolution of deficiencies in the existing recor d \nwithout the costs and delays inherent in restarting the medical -legal process . Directed \naugmentation of the record with the reporting physician also advances our constitutional mandate \nfor expeditious resolution of worker \u2019s compensation claims. (Cal. Const., Art.

This program lasted from 8/8/21 to 8/13/21. After returning to Shasta County, beginning on August 17th, she was on a hiring panel that performed oral interviews with candidates, and she estimated she spoke in person with about 16 candidates during this process. \nThe applicant was then assigned to work the Dixie Fire on August 21st. During this assignment \nshe began experiencing significant fatigue, sneezing, and coughing.   By the 23rd of August, the applicant was feeling very sick, and she went to the Hilltop Medical Clinic on 8/26/21. The Hilltop records document a history of fever, aches, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath and sore throat, and that these symptoms had been experienced over the previous 14 \ndays. The applicant\u2019s COVID 19 diagnosis was confirmed by PCR testing on 8/30/21. \nDuring this same time, the applicant\u2019s daughter also became sick, and tested positive for COVID \n19 on 8/22 or 8/23/21. The applicant assumed her daughter had caught COVID from daycare, but changed her mind several months later when she learned that no one at the daughter\u2019s daycare had such an infection. \nBecause of the applicant\u2019s increasing symptoms, she was admitted to the hospital on 9/1/21, and \nstayed hospitalized until her discharge on 9/25/21. While at the hospital, an additional diagnosis of COVID related pneumonia was made.  \nApplicant asserted that the COVID 19 infection she experienced in August of 2021 was work related, evoking the presumption of LC section 3212.87. Defendant/Petitioner denied liability, asserting that the applicant caught the virus from her daughter. \nThe parties used Dr. Scott Anderson as a PQME, and this evaluator wrote one report and was \ndeposed on one occasion. After clarification at deposition of some erroneous history the doctor had noted in his written report, he found that the applicant had likely caught the virus from work, and not from her daughter.   This question went to trial, and a Findings of Fact, Order and Opinion on Decision issued on 9/25/23. It is from this decision that the petitioner appeals. \nIII \nDISCUSSION  \nThe Petitioner agrees that the applicant has properly asserted the presumption of industrial injury as set forth in LC section 3212.87. \nThe effect of a presumption affecting the burden of proof is to impose upon the party against whom \nit operates the burden of proof as to the nonexistence of the presumed fact. ( Evidence Code \nsection 606; City of Long Beach v. WCAB (Garcia) 126 Cal. App. 4th 298, 314.) Once the facts giving rise to the presumption of industrial injury have been proven, the burden of negating the presumption falls on the employer.

Sevillano v. State of California 2022 Cal. Wrk. Comp. P.D. Lexis 255. \nLet us first dispense with the report and deposition transcript of the PQME, Dr. Anderson (Joint \nExhibits AA and BB). Even after being given the correct history at his deposition, this evaluator \nwas still firmly of the opinion that the applicant acquired h er COVID 19 at work. (Joint Exhibit \nBB, page 24: 18- 24; page 25: 2- 20). Petitioner argues that the opinion of this evaluator is not \nsubstantial evidence on this issue. If true, then the doctor\u2019s opinion offers petitioner no assistance \nin rebutting the pres umption. If it is substantial evidence, it supports the application of the \npresumption. Either way, it is of no assistance to the petitioner in accomplishing the rebuttal of the presumption. \nPetitioner next argues that the two employer witnesses who testified at trial establish through their \nsworn testimony that there were no Shasta County employees in August of 2021 that they were aware of that were COVID 19 positive. This testimony is unrebutted, and we may treat it as truthful and as showing that there was no one employed by Shasta County that these two county employees knew of with a COVID 19 infection during the relevant timeframe of August of 2021. \nHowever, the presumption of 3212.87 was not made law only to protect public employees from \ninfection through other employees. On the contrary, the idea was to lower the burden of proof for essential employees that \u201ckeep the lights on, water running, food s tocked, and treat our ill and \ninjured.\u201d The applicant\u2019s job required her not just to work with other county employees, but with the public, as well as other public employees. In this case, that specifically included interaction with about 40 other officers  from all over the state at the Sacramento seminar, with about 16 \ncandidates for employment with the county, and with the public and other public service providers \nduring the Dixie Fire, all in the month of August 2021. Because of this rather extensive exposure to non- Shasta County employees during the critical month of August 2021, the testimony of the \ntwo county witnesses does not establish that the applicant did not get her COVID infection from her job, only that perhaps a slice out of the pie of potenti al work related exposure vectors can be \nremoved. This testimony therefore does not serve as sufficient substantial evidence to rebut the presumption. \nNext, petitioner  argues that the applicant got the infection not from her work, but from her \ndaughter. However, the evidence in the case establishes that they both developed symptoms and \ntested positive within a few days of each other (Defendant\u2019s Exhibit A and F; Summary of \nTestimony, page 4: 24- 25), and no medical evidence specifically analyzes the situation to make a \nclear and unambiguous determination of who infected who.  \nPetitioner argues that because the applicant agrees she suffers from \u201cbrain fog\u201d as a result of her COVID 19 infection, none of her testimony can be trustworthy and from that, cannot be substantial evidence.  \nAlthough it is true that the applicant suffers from \u201cbrain fog,\u201d or more properly a cognitive impairment that affects her ability to accurately recall dates and events, that does not necessarily mean that all the applicant\u2019s testimony is automatically to b e rejected.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3492, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a0df6ee-341b-4c41-a553-57157e90916e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a0df6ee-341b-4c41-a553-57157e90916e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 337013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f0c2df22-3001-4922-8754-00946b66a75e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 337013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "cb107cc26f5c29f926dd7d51826b082a4d86857baf965b388406c0468beb9615", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "437295ee-31e0-4932-8de6-64edd830cd77", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 337013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "faad0dab4e20d45f1d69288de1f061ea7ebe16b1efffbc0a197c5c4dfe8f5565", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "554036bf-3c1d-4c12-b40b-825fe9da9f79", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "133eb0fe76a3f66f23027c6f0c21db95acf305b048b100545a410cff86bcf858", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c81d715b0279aeeb705a220d0da45434cdc3bd864bae757b80ecd07bd7cd7e94", "text": "6 \n Because of this, when considering the timeline of events, this judge compared the applicant\u2019s \ntestimony to the contemporaneous medical record to see if it would match up. In doing so, it could be determined that during her first visit to a doctor, at Hilltop Medical Clinic, on 8/26/21, a history was taken of a variety of COVID 19 related symptoms that she had been having over the last 14 days (Defendant\u2019s Exhibit A, page 23). This history is consistent with the applicant\u2019s testimony of \nher symptoms beginning in earnest on or about 8/21/21, and accelerating into significant illness \nby 8/23/21 (Summary of Testimony, page 4: 22- 24: page 6: 5- 7; 13- 14). \nMeanwhile, her daughter became sick on 8/22 and tested positive the next day. \nThe question of how the daughter got her COVID 19 infection is not addressed in any detail by \nany physician. Initially, the applicant believed the daughter caught the virus at daycare, but several \nmonths later learned that no one else there was sick in August. The applicant initially repeated this speculative history to the treaters, who simply repeated it in their reporting, but without any further discussio n or analysis. \nPetitioner argues that the applicant was first symptomatic on 8/26, citing doctor\u2019s notes from Mercy (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 3, page 22). However, the 26th was when the applicant first sought treatment at Hilltop, and those records in turn document numerous s ymptoms over the prior 14 \ndays. Although, as petitioner represents, that doesn\u2019t mean she had such symptoms for all 14 days, but it does support the applicant\u2019s testimony that her first symptoms occurred on or about 8/21, and then worsened to the point whe re she sought medical attention on 8/26. \nHowever, petitioner has offered no real medical evidence to support their position that the applicant got her infection from her daughter. The best petitioner can do is point to notations in the early medical record that record the daughter\u2019s concurrent CO VID 19 infection, but nothing \nmore. There is in the record no medical report offering any analysis or discussion of whether the applicant caught the virus from her daughter, or vice versa. Further, the PQME, Dr. Anderson, declined in his deposition to attr ibute the applicant\u2019s COVID 19 infection to her daughter (Joint \nExhibit BB, page 25: 3- 20). \nTherefore, the position that the applicant was infected by the daughter is conclusory and speculative. Such evidence is by definition not substantial. Merely offering a possible alternative scenario for infection is not the same as proving to a reasonable medical probability via substantial evidence that the applicant\u2019s infection did not come from her work.  \nTherefore, the petitioner\u2019s evidence does not rebut the presumption. \nIn summary, petitioner has offered only an argument that there is a possible alternative source for \nthe applicant\u2019s COVID 19 infection, but has offered no substantial medical evidence to support that position. Without such evidence, the petitioner\u2019s positi on boils down to the mere possibility \nthat the infection was non- industrial, which is in its face insufficient to rebut the presumption.",

Attorney\u2019s \nOffice, enjoys a rebuttable presumption under Labor Code section 3212.87 and Penal Code section 830.1 that the development of a COVID -19 infection was a compensable industrial injury. The \nparties agree that in August of 2021 the applicant developed such a COVID-19 infection, and this was confirmed within 14 days of her last day at work via a PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 2). Specifically, she last worked on August 21\nst, 2021 on the Dixie fire, and \nhad her COVID infection confirmed via PCR test on August 30th. \nThe question now presented is whether there are facts and evidence sufficient to rebut the presumptive industrial injury. \nWe must begin with the recognition that this is not the first time the applicant has had a COVID -\n19 infection. She testified under oath and without rebuttal that she had previously had a bout with \nthis virus in November of 2020 (Summary of Testimony, page 7: 5-6), and this was confirmed on the first page of the Mercy Medical records under the \u201chistory\u201d section (Defendant\u2019s Exhibit B). \nAt work, the events leading up to her positive test were interesting. In early August of 2021, she \nparticipated in a training program which required her to travel to Sacramento and lasted from 8/8/21 to 8/13/21. During that program, she trained with approximately 40 other officers from all over the state, and spent time sitting at tables together without masks. No one she could recall acted sick at this event (Summary of Testimony, page 4: 8-13). \nShe returned to work on the 17th of August, and then participated in oral board interviews on a \npanel interviewing people applying for jobs. She estimated they interviewed about 16 people. She did not recall anyone looking sick at this activity (Summary of Testimony, page 4: 15-19). \nNext, she was assigned to work the Dixie fire on August 21st. This job required her to patrol, \nprovide security, man checkpoints and meet with other agencies working the fire (Summary of Testimony, page 4: 20- 23). During this assignment, she began sneezing, coughing and feeling \ntired. She felt so tired one day that she overslept and was late for work. She described this at trial as a feeling of exhaustion (Summary of Testimony, page 4: 22- 24; page 6: 5 -7). At the earliest, the \napplicant began having symptoms on 8/21/21 (Summary of Testimony, page 6: 5- 7), or sometime \nbetween the 22nd and 24th of August, 2021 (Summary of Testimony, page 5: 9- 10). She testified \nthat by the 23rd of August, she was very sick (Summary of Testimony, page 6: 13- 14). Her first \nvisit to a doctor because of these symptoms occurred on 8/26/21 when she went to the Hilltop \nMedical Clinic. These records are in evidence as Defendant\u2019s Exhibit A. In the intake report, the doctor at Hilltop recorded symptoms of high fever, aches, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat and vomiting, and that these symptoms had been experienced over the last 14 days. This history is consistent with the applicant\u2019s testimony as cited above. \nThe applicant\u2019s COVID -19 diagnosis was confirmed by PCR testing on 8/30/21.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3242, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "672ade57-0f2d-4feb-b55c-434576e79c27": {"__data__": {"id_": "672ade57-0f2d-4feb-b55c-434576e79c27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 337013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce7f4a87-63c3-4ee7-9551-01f0ceb072ca", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 337013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "7c90a3caa81c9117df5969984cd2ec64245da926085cc084a3c8f45b1b5659b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "abb53844-c605-447b-a4b9-df1aba23c90a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 337013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "bb6af94cfca7ae550dbb35e4f89c9724242d4375f2ed725bbb1e8f55ab7d30b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fb0d5a19-1d3c-44f6-a9b3-3bd127a60812", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2547bcec094b71aa529ab8b4878c60d7f13099d95ec47d7f8907d3d822919cb9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c33a6882eb3384a13d4ddb9a9f91551457fca7a3a8286dc49d432bf964ae8130", "text": "9 \n Meanwhile, her daughter developed symptoms of COVID -19 and tested positive on 8/22 or \n8/23/21 (Defendant\u2019s Exhibit A and F; Summary of Testimony, page 4: 24-25). \nThe applicant testified that her daughter would normally go to daycare, and at least at first, the \napplicant assumed her daughter caught the virus from there. However, several months later, she learned that no other children at the daycare had come down wi th COVID -19. \nWhen the daughter developed COVID, she was taken out of daycare and quarantined at home, and the applicant requested leave from work to care for her on 8/24/21 (Defendant\u2019s Exhibit F). \nAt about this same time, the applicant did in fact become quite ill, and because of the increasing \nseverity of her symptoms was admitted to the hospital on 9/1/21, and kept there until her discharge on 9/25/21 (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 3). While at the hospital, the additional diagnosis of pneumonia in the applicant\u2019s lungs was made. \nThe applicant remained off work until January of 2022. At about that time, she became aware that \nnone of the other children at her daughter\u2019s daycare had come down with COVID -19. This new \ninformation caused her to wonder if she actually contracted her COVI D-19 infection at work. She \nfiled claim forms soon thereafter (Summary of Testimony, page 5: 17-24; page 7: 13-14). \nThe parties used Dr. Scott Anderson as a PQME, and he wrote one report and was deposed on one \noccasion (in evidence as Joint Exhibits AA and BB, respectively).\n \nFinding themselves unable to resolve the question of where the applicant acquired her COVID -19 \ninfection, whether or not the statutory presumption applied, or whether that presumption, if it applied, had been rebutted, the parties submitted these questions  to the board for decision after \ntrial. \nThis decision now issues. \nTHE LEGAL STANDARD \nIn response to the COVID -19 pandemic, the California Legislature passed Senate Bill 1159 which \nestablishes a rebuttable presumption that illness or death resulting from COVID -19 arose out of \nand in the course of employment for specified employees. SB 1159 was passed as an urgency statute and took effect immediately when signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sept. 17, 2020. \nSB 1159 adds three new Labor Code sections that establish COVID -19 presumptions, one of which \nwas LC section 3212.87, which applies to front -line workers (peace officers, firefighters, health -\ncare providers, home care workers and IHSS workers). In considering this legislation, the Legislature recognized that the pandemic nature of COVID -19 \nchallenged how infectious diseases historically have been handled in the workers' compensation \nsystem. The Senate Floor Analysis stated that, \"While COVID -19 is present in all California \ncommunities, the burden of fighting the disease has fallen disproportionately to a small group of workers in both the private and public sectors. These workers keep California's lights on, water running, food stocked, and treat our ill and injured.

The earliest for the applicant appears to be August 21st, when she experienced the symptom of severe exhaustion causing her to oversleep and be la te for \nwork.  \nFor the daughter, symptoms developed shortly before August 22nd and the daughter tested positive for COVID -19 on 8/22/21 or 8/23/21 (Summary of Testimony, page 4: 24- 25; Defendant\u2019s Exhibit \nF). \nThus, the two of them became symptomatic at about the same time, within a day or two of each other. \nSeveral obvious questions arise from this timeline, all of which require substantial medical opinion \nto answer.  \nFirst, what is the normal expected incubation period for a COVID -19 infection, and is that period \ndifferent for someone who has already had COVID at least once?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2544, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc56a16a-262c-40fc-a71e-a7cecf7b388a": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc56a16a-262c-40fc-a71e-a7cecf7b388a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 337013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49b5f4df-afd9-4de5-aa71-bdb9e6586d33", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 337013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "d02b83e65af4b6daea4e86523c57202f2119de860f5c340c6789eb25c79bbc9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb0d5a19-1d3c-44f6-a9b3-3bd127a60812", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 337013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "2547bcec094b71aa529ab8b4878c60d7f13099d95ec47d7f8907d3d822919cb9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e04a43d-8ab5-49fd-a280-f5d752fe8324", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "689f75e8580ae5a8f4ed8438877b7928a930e0468862b6fb23b2c6b60c7dd8aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8698a8fc668186a686f3b7dcb334a7f3c996cdb28a3f3b000c3a9882913a2410", "text": "11 \n Is it different depending on age? In other words, is the latency period different for an adult versus \na five year old child?  \nHow can one distinguish, if a determination can in fact be made on these facts, which person infected whom? Can that be done to a reasonable medical probability?  \nTo answer these questions, the parties used Dr. Scott Anderson as a PQME, and as defendant \npoints out, there are problems with that doctor\u2019s opinions.  \n \nFirst and foremost, in the initial report, Dr. Anderson stated that when the applicant was at work doing job interviews, several co- workers were quite sick. This history turned out not to be true, \nand at trial the applicant testified that she had no idea w here the doctor got that erroneous history. \nThis incorrect history was addressed in the doctor\u2019s deposition, but Dr. Anderson still was of the \nopinion that even if the applicant wasn\u2019t working with obviously sick co -workers, her infection \nmost likely came from work, due to her job duties which requi red close work with the public. \nWhen presented with the fact that the applicant\u2019s daughter also became ill with a COVID -19 \ninfection at about this time (but presented to the doctor as having tested positive four days before \nthe applicant \u2013 see page 25:12- 20, Joint Exhibit BB), the evalua tor still felt that the most likely \nsource of applicant\u2019s infection was her job.  \nThe evaluator asked to be provided with any medical records prior to the applicant\u2019s positive COVID test (page 23: 9 -20, Joint Exhibit BB) to determine whether or not the applicant was \ninfected by her daughter rather than from work exposure. These records, if any exist, were never \nprovided, nor was the doctor informed if they do not exist. \nDr. Anderson did not provide any analysis of why the daughter should be or should not be considered the source of the applicant\u2019s COVID -19 infection. \nThe doctor was asked about the relevance of the applicant\u2019s subsequent history of two additional COVID- 19 infections, but indicated he had not been told of that, and had seen no records, even \nthough he felt they might be relevant to his opinions (page 27: 14- 25; page 28: 1- 9). There is no \nevidence that any of these records were provided to the doctor.  \nIn summary, the PQME did not know about the applicants prior or subsequent COVID infections, and although he felt those records might be relevant, none were provided to him to consider, that we know of. The doctor was not asked to explain how it could be determined if the applicant was infected by her daughter rather than from work exposure, an especially important point given the two of them developed symptoms nearly simultaneously. The doctor did not provide a comprehensive analysis of why the applicant w as more likely to have been infected at work, rather \nthan via her daughter, other than the rather superficial statement that the multiple points of potential exposure at work were more convincing to him as a likely source.  \nThus, the evaluator does not address the key question presented in any detail, and is missing certain records that he thought might be relevant to his analysis.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3153, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e04a43d-8ab5-49fd-a280-f5d752fe8324": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e04a43d-8ab5-49fd-a280-f5d752fe8324", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 337013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "130b9aca-a538-4e3a-b481-2a508b02c57e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 337013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "c97aada6479307a8ce5c44b077c1bd1b229b11b7140b6e6ede35c12ad695e97e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc56a16a-262c-40fc-a71e-a7cecf7b388a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_path": "documents/Soksoda  Kehoe, Julie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 337013, "creation_date": "2024-01-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-06"}, "hash": "8698a8fc668186a686f3b7dcb334a7f3c996cdb28a3f3b000c3a9882913a2410", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c80053ac-4746-40cf-937f-91d7e8b0d2bd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "446968d9d2507c13433b7d3392bb36dc55a49df2c38b52d502d24997aa4b8231", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "689f75e8580ae5a8f4ed8438877b7928a930e0468862b6fb23b2c6b60c7dd8aa", "text": "12 \n If the PQME\u2019s report is not substantial evidence, it does nothing to support the defendant\u2019s position \nthat the presumption is rebutted.   If the PQME\u2019s report is substantial evidence, then it is evidence that the applicant\u2019s infection came from her work.  \n Neither supports the defendant\u2019s position that the presumption is rebutted. \nBacking away from this and looking at the case from a broader perspective, it can be seen that \nalthough the employer witnesses testified that no Shasta County employee that they knew of was COVID positive in August of 2021, many of the applicant\u2019s contacts  at work during the critical \nperiod were not Shasta County employees. Specifically, the applicant testified without contradiction that she interacted with about 40 other officers from around the state at the seminar in Sacramento, and then with about 16 candidates for employment with the county thereafter. By the time she began working the Dixie fire, she appears to have already begun to exhibit symptoms of her infection. Thus, there in fact were ample non -Shasta County employee work related contacts \nthat c ould easily explain her infection, especially during the seminar when people from all over \nthe state were gathered together in one place, interacting with each other at the seminar.  \nConsistent with the board\u2019s analysis in Sevillano, supra, the defendant needs to provide substantial medical evidence in support of their position that the applicant\u2019s infection, to a reasonable medical probability, came from her daughter, and not from her work.  \n The record is lacking in that substantial medical opinion.   The position that the applicant got her infection from the daughter is therefore speculative, especially when one considers that the evidence clearly establishes that they both began exhibiting symptoms at about the same time, and that no one at the daught er\u2019s day care was COVID positive \nduring the critical month of August. \nThe inescapable conclusion here is that the presumption that the applicant acquired her COVID -\n19 infection has not been rebutted. \nIS THE APPLICANT ENTITLED TO THE PRESUMPTION FOR PNEUMONIA PER \nLABOR CODE SECTION 3212.5?  \nLabor Code section 3212.5 establishes a pneumonia presumption if an investigator in a District \nAttorney\u2019s office, or Sheriff\u2019s Officer, develops pneumonia during a period when the person is in service to the District Attorney\u2019s office, as long as the perso n has served for five or more years in \nsuch capacity.  \nThe applicant testified at trial, under oath, that she started as an investigator at the DA\u2019s office in 2019, but  had worked as a Sheriff\u2019s Officer for ten years before that (Summary of Testimony, page \n3: 19-23).

On the second page of these records, it is noted that the applicant was admitted to the hospital with acute COVID -19 pneumonia. \nDr. Anderson was in agreement with this, noting on page 34 of Joint Exhibit AA that the applicant had acquired COVID -19 pneumonia, bilateral pneumothoraxes, pneumomediastinum and neuro-\ncognitive deficits secondary to hypoxemia. \nThere is no contrary medical evidence. The presumption of Labor Code section 3212.5 is therefore \nsatisfied, and the applicant\u2019s COVID -19 related pneumonia can be presumed to arise out of and in \nthe course of her employment with Shasta County. \nFurther, Dr. Anderson\u2019s statement that her neuro -cognitive deficits, which the applicant amply \ndescribed in her trial testimony, were derivative of her hypoxemia, which in turn was caused by \nher COVID -19 infection.
